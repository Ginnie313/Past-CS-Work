  Daniel's Perlman repository has the database in it (majorsInformation)

The files for Phase3 and what they are:

  MajorsDatabase.sql--a file that we created to contain all the SQL needed to
  make the database from our original CSV file

  api.py--File that contains the actual API and SQL methods to get info from our
  database. Note, this file has some wrapper methods that aren't fully implemented.
  We just have them in as placeholders so we can figure out how to implement the
  JavaScript code later.

  api_tests.py--File that contains all the the tests we wrote for the implemented
  methods of api.py

  config.py--Passes in a database name and user name to api.py for security
